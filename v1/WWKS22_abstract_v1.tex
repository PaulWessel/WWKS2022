Seamounts are volcanic constructs that litter the seafloor.
They are important for understanding numerous aspects of marine science, such as
plate tectonics, the volcanic melt budget, oceanic circulation, tsunami wave diffraction,
tidal energy dissipation, and mass wasting. Geometrically, seamounts come in many sizes and shapes,
and for the purpose of modeling them for morphological, gravimetric or isostatic studies
it is convenient to have simple analytical models whose properties are well known.  Here,
we present a family of seamount models that may be used in such studies, and we derive
realistic axisymmetric density variations that support observed first-order structure
from seismic tomography studies.
